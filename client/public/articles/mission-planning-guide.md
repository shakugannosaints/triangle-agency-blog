# Mission Planning Guide for Game Masters

Planning missions is one of the most important aspects of running a successful Triangle Agency campaign. This guide will help you create engaging, challenging, and memorable missions for your operatives.

## The Mission Structure

A well-structured mission typically includes several key components:

### 1. The Briefing

The mission begins with operatives receiving their assignment. A good briefing should:
- Clearly state the primary objective
- Provide necessary background information
- Hint at potential complications
- Establish the stakes and consequences

### 2. The Approach Phase

This is where operatives plan their approach and gather information. Allow them to:
- Research the target or location
- Gather intelligence
- Prepare equipment and resources
- Develop contingency plans

### 3. The Execution Phase

The main action of the mission where operatives:
- Carry out their plan
- Deal with complications
- Make critical decisions
- Face unexpected challenges

### 4. The Resolution Phase

The aftermath of the mission where:
- Consequences unfold
- Operatives debrief
- Rewards are distributed
- Seeds for future missions are planted

## Mission Design Principles

### Clarity of Objectives

Operatives should understand what success looks like. However, the path to success should remain flexible and open to player creativity.

### Multiple Solutions

Design missions that can be completed in multiple ways. This rewards creative thinking and prevents the campaign from becoming linear.

### Meaningful Consequences

Ensure that operative choices matter. Success and failure should have real consequences that affect the campaign world.

### Appropriate Challenge

Balance difficulty to keep the mission engaging without being overwhelming. Consider the party's capabilities and experience level.

## Common Mission Types

### Investigation Missions

Operatives must uncover information or solve a mystery. These missions emphasize:
- Clue gathering
- Deduction
- Social interaction
- Information management

### Extraction Missions

Operatives must retrieve a person, object, or information. These missions emphasize:
- Planning and preparation
- Risk assessment
- Tactical decision-making
- Time pressure

### Infiltration Missions

Operatives must enter a secure location undetected. These missions emphasize:
- Stealth and deception
- Problem-solving
- Improvisation
- Tension management

### Elimination Missions

Operatives must neutralize a threat. These missions emphasize:
- Combat readiness
- Tactical positioning
- Resource management
- Moral complexity

## Tips for Effective Mission Planning

### Prepare, But Stay Flexible

Have your mission framework prepared, but be ready to adapt based on player choices. The best moments often come from unexpected directions.

### Use NPCs Effectively

Create memorable NPCs who can provide information, complications, or moral dilemmas. NPCs make missions feel alive and personal.

### Build Tension Gradually

Start missions with lower stakes and gradually increase the pressure. This creates a satisfying narrative arc.

### Leave Room for Improvisation

Not everything needs to be scripted. Allow space for player creativity and unexpected solutions.

### Debrief and Reflect

After each mission, take time to discuss what worked and what didn't. Use this feedback to improve future missions.

## Mission Complications

Add depth to your missions by introducing complications:

- **Time Pressure**: Operatives must complete the mission before a deadline
- **Moral Dilemmas**: Completing the objective might require morally questionable actions
- **Competing Objectives**: Multiple goals that might conflict with each other
- **Unexpected Allies/Enemies**: NPCs whose allegiances are unclear or change
- **Environmental Hazards**: The location itself presents dangers
- **Resource Limitations**: Operatives have limited equipment or information

## Conclusion

Mission planning is both an art and a science. By understanding the structure of effective missions and applying these principles, you can create campaigns that your players will remember for years to come.
