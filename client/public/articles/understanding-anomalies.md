# Understanding Anomalies in Triangle Agency

Anomalies are one of the most fascinating and mysterious elements of Triangle Agency. They represent the unknown, the dangerous, and the extraordinary within the game world. This guide will help you understand what anomalies are and how to effectively use them in your campaigns.

## What Are Anomalies?

Anomalies are supernatural or extraordinary phenomena that exist within the Triangle Agency universe. They defy conventional explanation and represent threats, opportunities, or mysteries that the operatives must investigate and manage.

### Characteristics of Anomalies

- **Unpredictable**: Anomalies often behave in ways that challenge conventional logic
- **Dangerous**: They pose genuine threats to operatives and the world at large
- **Mysterious**: Their origins and true nature are often unknown
- **Evolving**: Anomalies can change, grow, or develop in unexpected ways

## Types of Anomalies

### Physical Anomalies

Physical anomalies manifest as tangible phenomena in the environment. Examples include:
- Spatial distortions
- Temporal anomalies
- Environmental hazards
- Biological mutations

### Psychological Anomalies

These anomalies affect the mind and perception:
- Reality distortions
- Psychological compulsions
- Memory alterations
- Perception shifts

### Organizational Anomalies

These relate to the Triangle Agency itself and its operations:
- Rogue operatives
- Compromised facilities
- Corrupted data
- Organizational conflicts

## Using Anomalies in Your Campaign

### Creating Tension

Anomalies are excellent tools for creating tension and uncertainty in your campaign. The unpredictable nature of anomalies means that operatives can never be completely sure of what they're facing.

### Driving the Plot

Anomalies can serve as the central mystery or conflict driving your campaign forward. Investigating anomalies can lead operatives deeper into the secrets of the Triangle Agency.

### Character Development

Encounters with anomalies can profoundly affect operatives' understanding of the world and their place within it. These encounters can drive character growth and transformation.

## Managing Anomalies as a GM

### Consistency Within Mystery

While anomalies should feel mysterious and unpredictable, they should still follow internal logic. Establish rules for how each anomaly behaves and stick to them.

### Escalation

Consider how anomalies might escalate or change over time. This creates a sense of progression and increasing stakes.

### Player Agency

Ensure that players have meaningful choices in how they interact with anomalies. Avoid situations where anomalies simply happen to the party.

## Conclusion

Anomalies are a core element of Triangle Agency that can add depth, mystery, and excitement to your campaigns. By understanding their nature and using them effectively, you can create memorable experiences for your players.
